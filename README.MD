## Sackboy and the Collector: A Love Story

Sackboy was a brave and adventurous hero, who loved to explore the world of LittleBigPlanet. He had many friends, such as Larry Da Vinci, Avalon Centrifuge, and Victoria Von Bathysphere, who helped him on his quests to save the planet from various threats.

The Collector was a mysterious and lonely villain, who had a passion for collecting things. He had no friends, only his army of robots, who obeyed his every command. He was obsessed with capturing all the creations of LittleBigPlanet, and storing them in his massive bunker.

One day, Sackboy stumbled upon the Collector's bunker, while looking for a new sticker. He was curious and decided to sneak inside, hoping to find some treasures. He was amazed by the sight of the bunker, which was filled with countless objects, from cars and planes, to animals and plants, to paintings and sculptures.

He wandered around the bunker, admiring the collection, until he reached a section that was labeled "Sackpeople". There, he saw hundreds of cages, each containing a Sackperson. He recognized some of them as his friends, who had gone missing over the years. He felt a surge of anger and sadness, and decided to free them.

He grabbed a pair of scissors and started to cut the wires that locked the cages. He was careful not to make any noise, as he did not want to alert the Collector. He managed to free several Sackpeople, who thanked him and ran away.

However, as he was about to free the last cage, he heard a loud voice behind him.

"Stop right there, intruder!"

He turned around and saw the Collector, who had returned from his latest raid. He was holding a remote control, which could activate the security system of the bunker. He looked furious and menacing.

"Who are you, and what are you doing in my bunker?" he demanded.

Sackboy was scared, but he did not lose his courage. He answered, "I'm Sackboy, and I'm here to rescue my friends. You have no right to keep them here. They belong to LittleBigPlanet, not to you."

The Collector scoffed, "Your friends? They are not your friends, they are my collection. They are rare and valuable, and I have spent years finding them. They are mine, and you have no right to touch them."

He pressed a button on his remote, and the cages snapped shut again. He then pressed another button, and a metal door slammed down, blocking the exit.

"You have made a big mistake, Sackboy. You have trespassed on my property, and you have tried to steal from me. You will pay for this. You will become part of my collection, too."

He pressed another button, and a large robot emerged from the shadows. It had a claw, a drill, and a laser, and it looked ready to capture Sackboy.

"Say hello to my latest invention, the Sack-Catcher 3000. It will grab you, scan you, and store you in a special cage, where you will stay forever. You will never see the light of day again. You will never see your friends again. You will be mine, and only mine."

He laughed maniacally, as the robot approached Sackboy.

Sackboy was terrified, but he did not give up. He looked around, and saw a pile of objects nearby. He grabbed a frying pan, a rubber duck, and a balloon, and threw them at the robot. The objects bounced off the robot, but they distracted it long enough for Sackboy to run past it.

He ran towards the metal door, hoping to find a way out. He saw a small gap under the door, and tried to squeeze through it. He managed to get his head and one arm out, but the rest of his body was stuck.

He looked outside, and saw a bright and colorful world. He saw the sun, the sky, the trees, and the flowers. He saw other Sackpeople, who were playing and having fun. He saw his friends, who were waiting for him.

He smiled, and felt a warm and fuzzy feeling in his chest. He realized that he loved LittleBigPlanet, and he loved his friends. He also realized that he loved life, and he wanted to live.

He tried to pull himself out, but it was too late. The robot had caught up with him, and grabbed his legs. It pulled him back into the bunker, and dragged him towards the cage.

Sackboy screamed, and struggled, but it was no use. He was trapped, and he knew it. He felt a cold and dark feeling in his chest. He realized that he hated the Collector, and he hated his bunker. He also realized that he hated being alone, and he wanted to be free.

He looked at the Collector, who was watching him with a smug and satisfied expression. He felt a surge of anger and resentment, and decided to confront him.

He shouted, "Why are you doing this? Why are you so mean and selfish? Why do you collect things that are not yours? Why do you keep them locked up in this horrible place? Why don't you let them go?"

The Collector was surprised by Sackboy's words. He had never heard anyone talk to him like that. He had never heard anyone talk to him at all. He felt a strange and unfamiliar feeling in his chest. He realized that he was curious about Sackboy, and he wanted to know more. He also realized that he was lonely, and he wanted to talk.

He answered, "I'm doing this because I love collecting things. I love finding rare and unique things, and making them mine. I love having a big and impressive collection, that no one else has. I love being the best collector in the world."

He paused, and then added, "But I also do this because I have nothing else. I have no friends, no family, no home. I have no one who cares about me, or who I care about. I have no one who understands me, or who I understand. I have no one who loves me, or who I love."

He looked at Sackboy, and saw a small and cute creature, who had a lot of courage and spirit. He saw a creature who had friends, who had a home, who had a life. He saw a creature who was different from him, but who was also similar to him.

He smiled, and felt a warm and fuzzy feeling in his chest. He realized that he liked Sackboy, and he wanted to be his friend. He also realized that he liked life, and he wanted to live.

He pressed a button on his remote, and the robot released Sackboy. He then pressed another button, and the metal door opened. He then pressed another button, and all the cages opened. He then pressed another button, and the security system turned off.

He walked towards Sackboy, and offered him his hand.

He said, "I'm sorry, Sackboy. I'm sorry for what I did to you, and to your friends. I'm sorry for being mean and selfish. I'm sorry for collecting things that are not mine. I'm sorry for keeping them locked up in this horrible place. I'm sorry for not letting them go."

He paused, and then added, "But I'm also grateful, Sackboy. I'm grateful for what you did for me, and for your friends. I'm grateful for being brave and adventurous. I'm grateful for being curious and creative. I'm grateful for being kind and generous. I'm grateful for being alive."

He looked at Sackboy, and saw a smile on his face. He saw a sparkle in his eyes. He saw a friend.

He smiled, and felt a warm and fuzzy feeling in his chest. He realized that he loved Sackboy, and he wanted to be with him. He also realized that he loved LittleBigPlanet, and he wanted to explore it.

He asked, "Will you forgive me, Sackboy? Will you be my friend? Will you be my partner? Will you be mine?"

Sackboy looked at the Collector, and saw a change in him. He saw a kind and gentle soul, who had a passion for collecting things. He saw a soul who had been lonely and unhappy, but who had found happiness and love. He saw a soul who was different from him, but who was also similar to him.

He smiled, and felt a warm and fuzzy feeling in his chest. He realized that he loved the Collector, and he wanted to be with him. He also realized that he loved collecting things, and he wanted to share it with him.

He took his hand, and nodded.

He said, "I forgive you, Collector. I'll be your friend. I'll be your partner. I'll be yours."

They hugged, and kissed, and felt a warm and fuzzy feeling in their chests. They realized that they were happy, and they wanted to stay that way.

They walked out of the bunker, hand in hand, and joined their friends. They saw the sun, the sky, the trees, and the flowers. They saw other Sackpeople, who were playing and having fun. They saw their friends, who were happy for them.

They smiled, and felt a warm and fuzzy feeling in their chests. They realized that they loved each other, and they wanted to show it.

They decided to create a new sticker, with their names and a heart. They decided to stick it on their chests, and on their friends' chests. They decided to stick it on everything they saw, and everything they collected.

They decided to stick it on LittleBigPlanet.
